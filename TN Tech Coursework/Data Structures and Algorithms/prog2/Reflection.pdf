    I surprisingly enjoyed this assignment. While it was a headache to figure out
a few things, I have only myself to blame because I waited until the very last
minute to do this. In fact I am writing this just under two hours before I am
supposed to submit it. Luckily I am in fact finished. The list class itelf
wasn't that difficult to write, it was mostly the mergesort algorithm that
gave me some issues, as you might have expected. I appreciate the info about 
comparing the T objects and what the return type needs to be when returning the 
node, although it might help others if this is bold or you make it stand out 
more, just because I looked over them at first. At first I had an issue or two
with the split algorithm, but I quickly solved it. Also, it was tricky figuring 
out how to set the recursive merge algorithm's return node's previous pointer 
to the originally selected node. Essentially the wording in the merge function 
instructions was difficult to figure out at first, but eventually I got it. 
This program wasn't too difficult to figure out, and it gave me a better under-
standing of the merge sort algorithm and practice with recursion. Another thing
that wasn't clear was how you wanted the print function to look or what info 
needed to be printed, so I just ended up printing index and population of each
county in the list, since those were the ones with public accessor functions.

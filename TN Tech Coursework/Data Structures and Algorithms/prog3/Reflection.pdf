    This was by far the easiest programming assignment we have done in this class.
It didn't take me too long to figure out what I was doing with everything, and
I slowly put it all together, getting a better understanding of it's function as a
whole. At some point, I got it all put together (at least I thought) and I tried to
compile, which it did no problem. However, when running the program, nothing would
print on the screen and it would be stuck loading for forever. I eventually realized
that I didn't set the tableSize variable to the size given in the constructor, and
that is what fixed that issue. After that, I realized that my remove function wasn't
actually stitching my bucket list back together but just deleting the entry, which I
realized would become a problem very quickly. After fixing that, I had no issues.
Overall I would say I am happy with the work I did, even if I made some dumb mistakes
along the way.
